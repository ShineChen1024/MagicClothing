    For each feature map, select the `pre_nms_topk` highest scoring proposals,
    apply NMS, clip proposals, and remove small boxes. Return the `post_nms_topk`
    highest scoring proposals among all the feature maps if `training` is True,
    otherwise, returns the highest `post_nms_topk` scoring proposals for each
    feature map.

    Args:
        proposals (list[Tensor]): A list of L tensors. Tensor i has shape (N, Hi*Wi*A, 5).
            All proposal predictions on the feature maps.
        pred_objectness_logits (list[Tensor]): A list of L tensors. Tensor i has shape (N, Hi*Wi*A).
        images (ImageList): Input images as an :class:`ImageList`.
        nms_thresh (float): IoU threshold to use for NMS
        pre_nms_topk (int): number of top k scoring proposals to keep before applying NMS.
            When RRPN is run on multiple feature maps (as in FPN) this number is per
            feature map.
        post_nms_topk (int): number of top k scoring proposals to keep after applying NMS.
            When RRPN is run on multiple feature maps (as in FPN) this number is total,
            over all feature maps.
        min_box_side_len (float): minimum proposal box side length in pixels (absolute units
            wrt input images).
        training (bool): True if proposals are to be used in training, otherwise False.
