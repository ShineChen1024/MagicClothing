# Unexpected behaviors & bugs are split to two templates.
# When they are one template, users think "it's not a bug" and don't choose the template.
#
# But the file name is still "unexpected-problems-bugs.md" so that old references
# to this issue template still works.
# It's ok since this template should be a superset of "bugs.md" (unexpected behaviors is a superset of bugs)
