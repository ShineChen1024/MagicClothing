## News
ðŸ”¥ [2024/4/17] A stable version for other advanced extensions will be released soon!

ðŸ”¥ [2024/4/16] Our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09512) is available now!

ðŸ”¥ [2024/3/8] We released the model weights trained on the 768 resolution. The strength of clothing and text prompts can be independently adjusted.

ðŸ”¥ [2024/2/28] We support [IP-Adapter-FaceID](https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter-FaceID) with [ControlNet-Openpose](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet-v1-1-nightly)! A portrait and a reference pose image can be used as additional conditions.

Have fun with ***gradio_ipadapter_openpose.py***

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ShineChen1024/MagicClothing.git
```

2. Create a conda environment and install the required packages

```sh
conda create -n magicloth python==3.10
conda activate magicloth
pip install torch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 numpy==1.25.1 diffusers==0.25.1 opencv-python==4.9.0.80  transformers==4.31.0 gradio==4.16.0 safetensors==0.3.1 controlnet-aux==0.0.6 accelerate==0.21.0
```

## Inference

1. Python demo

> 512 weights

```sh
python inference.py --cloth_path [your cloth path] --model_path [your model checkpoints path]
```

> 768 weights

```sh
python inference.py --cloth_path [your cloth path] --model_path [your model checkpoints path] --enable_cloth_guidance
```

2. Gradio demo

> 512 weights

```sh
python gradio_generate.py --model_path [your model checkpoints path] 
```

> 768 weights

```sh
python gradio_generate.py --model_path [your model checkpoints path] --enable_cloth_guidance
```
